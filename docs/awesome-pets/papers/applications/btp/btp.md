# Biometric Template Protection (BTP)

Biometric recognition is an emerging biometric technology that enables authentication and identification of individuals based on their unique biometrics, such as, face, fingerprints and iris. However, the increasing popularity of biometric technologies also raises privacy and security concerns, as biometrics are lifelong and irreplaceable identifiers that could be disclosed or misused.

Biometric template protection is a form of encrypted biometrics that satisfies the following three properties: irreversibility, renewability, and unlinkability. While preserving the ability of correct recognition from encrypted biometrics, they are not allowed to infer any useful information about the owner.

Basically, there are two sorts of techinques: Cancelable biometrics (CB) and Biometric Cryptosystem (BC). Cancelable biometrics transforms the biometric template into a form using highly nonlinear and uninvertible maps, while biometric cryptosystem combines cryptographic primitives with error correction codes and associates with biometrics.
