"To facilitate users who do not have access to a real TEE environment, "
"SecretFlow offers a TEEU simulation mode. This feature allows users to "
"try out TEEU functions on an ordinary machine. Code writing and usage in "
"the simulation mode are almost same with the non-simulation mode, so it "

"verification first."

"Note that since the real TEE environment is not used, the simulation mode"
" lacks security features that depend on the TEE environment, such as "
