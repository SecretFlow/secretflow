"The design goal of SecretFlow is to make it very easy for data scientists"
" and machine learning developers to use private computing techniques for "
"data analysis and machine learning without knowing the underlying "
"technical details. To achieve this goal, SecretFlow provides a layer of "
"device abstraction that abstracts Multi-Party Secure Computing (MPC), "
"Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) into"
" ciphertext devices. Based on this level of abstraction, data analysis "
"and machine learning workflows can be represented as a computational "
"graph, where nodes represent computations on a device and edges represent"
" the data flow between devices. Data flow between different types of "
"devices requires protocol conversion. In this regard, SecretFlow borrows "
"from mainstream deep learning frameworks, which represent neural networks"
" as a computational graph consisting of on-device operators and tensor "
"flows between devices."
